trees can be tall. Whatever kind,
I like them all.
They give us oxygen, they give us air. We give them love, we give them care.</p>

            <p>A mighty wind blew night and day. It stole the oak tree's leaves away, Then snapped its boughs and pulled its bark Until the oak was tired and stark. But still the oak tree held its ground While other trees fell all around. The weary wind gave up and spoke, "How can you still be standing, Oak?" The oak tree said, "I know that you Can break each branch of mine in two, Carry every leaf away,
Shake my limbs, and make me sway. But I have roots stretched in the earth, Growing stronger since my birth. You'll never touch them, for you see, They are the deepest part of me. Until today, I wasn't sure Of just how much I could endure. But now I've found, with thanks to you, I'm stronger than I ever knew."

            <p>Free not from the cold.
not from the wind.
Not from the ice and snow.
But free
From The Billemness.
The blast.
The burden.
AND HE SHALL BE
Free
LIKE A TREE
Not from the sain.
PSALM 1:3
Not from the hail.
Not from the fire and heat.
But free
From the drench The sting. The ashes.
Free to live.
Free to survive - In spite of it all. Free to thrive.
