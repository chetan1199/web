        <p class="rating">★★★★★</p>
        <p class="review">From the day it found its place in print till now, it has been a more appealing novel to teenagers and to all the lovers of literature who loves romance. Pride and Prejudice is a character-driven narrative focuses on Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the novel.

The novel is set in the late 18th century, thus, one could see a lot of possibilities and consideration of marriage. Despite, love and marriage being the prominent themes in the novel, there is no violence or physical attraction in the story at all. Even during Lydia’s elopement, the readers were left to infer their attachment or living as husband and wife, with no hint to their attraction or attachments. Also, Lydia’s marriage with Wickham despite the family knowing his true nature is another constraint of the time Austen lived.

        <p class="rating">★★★★★</p>
        <p class="review">"Romeo and Juliet" is a timeless exploration of love, fate, and the destructive power of familial conflict, set against the vibrant backdrop of Verona. Shakespeare's richly developed characters and eloquent writing capture the intense passion and tragic consequences of young love. The play continues to resonate with audiences.

        <p class="author">Elizabeth Rudnick</p>
        <p class="rating">★★★★★</p>
        <p class="review">Elizabeth Rudnick has gracefully adapted the tale as old as time. The book has so much detail that it felt as if I experienced the joy, heartbreak, laughter, and sorrow of all the characters.

You may ask what makes this book different from the original tale. To me, it is without a doubt a magical gateway to a fantasy world. This world has a beautiful enchantress, a cursed prince who was turned into his true inner beast, the prince’s staff who were transformed into talking and moving objects, and a heroine very different from other people. Belle is not the typical fairy tale princess. She is a modern, intelligent women.

I gave this book a 5/5 because this book is truly unforgettable. It has an elegance that gives you a feeling of uttermost happiness and love. It can be enjoyed by all members of the family – old and young alike. This book gave me a feeling of true affection.
